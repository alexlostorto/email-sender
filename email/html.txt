      Dear [Company Name],<br /><br />
      My name is Alex, and I am a highly motivated Year 11 student from NUSA studying GCSEs in Product Design, Psychology, Statistics, Computer Science, Further Maths and Spanish - with predicted straight 9s.<br /><br />
      I am inquiring about a potential work experience placement at [Company Name] at any time from Monday 3rd July to Friday 21st July 2023.<br /><br />
      Ever since my first project, which utilised question UUIDs and MathJax to harvest all the answers to my Maths homework, I have had a deep fascination for programming. Whether it's developing a Chrome extension that encourages students to learn efficiently or creating the front-end that
      interacts with an API, I fully immerse myself in every project. 50,000+ lines of code later and countless hours of my life lost to debugging, I have developed patience, perseverance and the ever-growing desire to learn more. With a solid foundation in programming languages such as Python,
      Javascript, and HTML/CSS, I am prepared to contribute to your team by assisting with software development tasks and collaborating on real-world projects.<br /><br />
      With experience in marketing and setting up an online hand-made card business, I have excellent attention to detail and thoroughly enjoy interacting with my community. Currently, I volunteer as a reading tutor for immigrant students, but I have also led drama groups, taught English in
      Indonesia (my home country), delegated roles and portrayed successful leadership in order to work cohesively and ensure the original brief is accomplished. I also have a few regional karate medals, reinforcing my discipline, resilience and constant aim for self-improvement.<br /><br />
      I am committed to professionalism, confidentiality, and meeting deadlines. I am confident that my strong work ethic and attention to detail will make me a valuable asset to your team. I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss this work experience placement further and provide any
      additional information or references.<br /><br />
      As an enthusiastic student with a keen interest in what your organisation does, alongside an ability to learn new things and progress in this industry, I would be very grateful to be considered for an opportunity at [Company Name].<br /><br />
      I am excited to hear from you soon.<br /><br />
      Yours faithfully,<br /><br />
      Alex lo Storto<br /><br />
